A smart irrigation system is built to monitor the field environment and to control the water pump remotely from anywhere in the world. This project was built using NodeMCU ESP8266, Soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, and power relay module. It uses a relay module to ON/OFF the pump. This project is designed with Blink cloud.
